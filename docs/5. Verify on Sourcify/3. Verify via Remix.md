You can use the ["Unified Verification Plugin"](https://github.com/remix-project-org/remix-project/tree/master/apps/contract-verification) written by the Sourcify team to verify on multiple verifiers on Remix.

1. Click on the "Plugins" tab in bottom of the sidebar and search for "Contract Verification"
2. Enable the plugin "Contract Verification"
3. Click on the "Contract Verification" tab in the sidebar
4. Enter the contract address and select a chain
5. Select the contract to verify (you need to have compiled a contract on Remix first)
6. By default all verifiers are enabled. For Etherscan you need to add your API key in the "Settings" tab
7. You can see the verification result in the "Receipts" tab
