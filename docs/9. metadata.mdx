# Contract metadata

<AvailableOnlyForSolidityAdmonition description="Vyper contracts don't support metadata."/>

## Metadata

Since [v0.4.7](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/releases/tag/v0.4.7) (2016-12-15) Solidity compiler generates an output file called metadata that contains information about the contract and the compilation ([see Solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/metadata.html)). This includes the compiler settings, [contract ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/abi-spec.html), [NatSpec contract documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/natspec-format.html), and used source files and their hashes. Sourcify takes full advantage of this information to [fully verify](/docs/full-vs-partial-match) a deployed contract i.e. a byte-by-byte match of the contract. **Metadata file is required for the Sourcify verification** alongside the Solidity source files.

To see metadata in action check out the [Metadata Playground](https://playground.sourcify.dev).

Check [Matches](/docs/full-vs-partial-match) to understand how Sourcify uses the metadata for verification

## Where to find

### Solidity compiler

You can pass the `--metadata` flag to the Solidity command line compiler to get the metadata output printed.

```bash
solc --metadata MyContract.sol
```

Write the metadata into a file with

```bash
solc --metadata MyContract.sol > metadata.json
```

### Standard JSON Input-Output

To have the metadata in the ouput of the compilation with Solidity's [standard JSON](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description), add `metadata` to the `outputSelection` of the compilation input JSON. Below example outputs metadata for all contracts compiled.

```json
    "outputSelection": {
      "*": {
        "*": [
          "metadata", // <--
          "evm.bytecode",
          "evm.bytecode.sourceMap"
        ],
        ...
      },
      ...
    }
```
### Foundry

Foundry stores the contract compilation outputs to `out/CONTRACT_NAME` folder. The `.json` file contains the metadata of the contract under `"rawMetadata"` and `"metadata"` fields. However you don't need to extract the metadata manually for verification.

You can use the `forge verify-contract` command to verify a contract. See [Foundry verification](/docs/how-to-verify/#Foundry) for more details.

Simply drag and drop the output `.json` file of the contract you want to verify to the [sourcify.dev](https://sourcify.dev) UI or provide it as the metadata file to the [API](/docs/api).


### Hardhat

You can use the native Hardhat [verify plugin](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/plugins/nomicfoundation-hardhat-verify#verifying-on-sourcify) to verify your contracts. See [Hardhat verification](/docs/how-to-verify/#with-hardhat-plugin) for more details.

Hardhat stores the outputs of the compilations under the `artifacts/build-info/` folder inside the project. The `.json` file under the folder contains the [Standard JSON Input-Output](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/using-the-compiler.html#compiler-input-and-output-json-description) of the Solidity compiler for all contracts.

Since [v2.6.8](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/releases/tag/hardhat%402.6.8), Hardhat outputs the metadata files of each contract by default under the JSON's `.output.contracts.<contract-path>.<contract-name>.metadata` field. You don't have to extract the metadata manually. To verify via the Hardhat output you can provide the JSON containing the artifacts to Sourcify via UI or API. See [Hardhat verification](/docs/how-to-verify/#with-hardhat-output) for more details. If the file is too large, try zippping it and uploading the zip file.

### Hardhat - earlier than v2.6.8

If you use an earlier version of Hardhat than 2.6.8 you can modify the `hardhat-config.js` manually to output metadata inside the `build-info/` file:

```js
// hardat-config.js
module.exports = {
  ...
  solidity: {
    settings: {
      version: ...,
      optimizer: {...},
      outputSelection: {
        "*": {
          "*": [
            "abi",
            "evm.bytecode",
            "evm.deployedBytecode",
            "metadata", // <-- add this
            ...
          ]
        },
      },
    },
  },
  ...
};
```

In theory, if you haven't changed any of the compilation settings, it should result in the same metadata file and you should get a full match. Otherwise you will be able to get a partial match only.

### Truffle

Truffle stores the contract compilation outputs to `build/contracts/` folder. The `.json` file contains the metadata of the contract. You don't need to extract the metadata manually.

Simply drag and drop the output `.json` file of the contract you want to verify to the [sourcify.dev](https://sourcify.dev) UI.
