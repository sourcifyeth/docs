Sourcify ([sourcify.dev](https://sourcify.dev)) is a source-code verification service for Ethereum smart contracts supporting Solidity and Vyper. Sourcify is fully commited to Open-source, Open-data and Open-standards in smart-contract verification instead of siloed, propriety services. We foster these values across the ecosystem and work actively to push the status-quo in this direction.

Different than other verification services, Sourcify leverages the [Solidity metadata](/docs/metadata/) and its integrity hash to find [exact matches](/docs/exact-match-vs-match/) of Solidity contracts (see [the playground](https://playground.sourcify.dev)).
