Sourcify ([sourcify.dev](https://sourcify.dev)) is a source-code verification service for Ethereum smart contracts supporting Solidity, Vyper, and Yul. Sourcify is fully committed to Open-source, Open-data, and Open-standards in smart-contract verification instead of siloed, proprietary services. We foster these values across the ecosystem and work actively to push the status quo in this direction.

Different than other verification services, Sourcify leverages the [Solidity metadata](/docs/metadata/) and its integrity hash to find [exact matches](/docs/exact-match-vs-match/) of Solidity contracts (see [the playground](https://playground.sourcify.dev)).

## How the docs are structured

- Start with [What is source code verification](/docs/what-is-source-code-verification) for verification basics and methods (UI, Remix, Hardhat, Foundry, API).
- Continue with [Sourcify in depth](/docs/exact-match-vs-match/) for matching, metadata, database, monitoring, and transformations.
- Use [Contract dataset](/docs/repository/) for repository browsing, signature lookup, and dataset export.
- Go to [API](/docs/api) for Sourcify's APIs.
- Go to [Integrate Sourcify](/docs/lib-sourcify/) to verify contracts directly in your application.
- Use [Run your own Sourcify instance](/docs/running-server) for self-hosting server components.
