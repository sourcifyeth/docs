# File Repositories

:::danger Deprecation Notice
The file repositories are **deprecated** and no longer supported.

Only the IPFS pinning service still uses the logical structure of RepositoryV2 for uploading files to IPFS.

For custom Sourcify instances, we recommend migrating to APIv2 and the [Database](/docs/repository/sourcify-database/) as the main storage backend. See the [migration guide](/docs/database-migration).
:::

This page describes the `RepositoryV1` and `RepositoryV2`, which are file systems (deprecated).

## RepositoryV1 vs RepositoryV2

### RepositoryV1
RepositoryV1 is the legacy storage backend for files. It is simply a file system based on how file paths are given in the [Solidity metadata](/docs/metadata). file.

An [example metadata](https://repo.sourcify.dev/contracts/full_match/1/0x801f3983c7baBF5E6ae192c84E1257844aDb4b4D/metadata.json) source file paths look like this for the "full_match" contract `0x801f3983c7baBF5E6ae192c84E1257844aDb4b4D` on Ethereum Mainnet (1):
```json
{
  "sources": {
    "erc20/IERC20.sol": {
      "keccak256": "0xa38ec4e151e4d397d05bdfb94e6e4eb91e57a9fca3bc1c655289a4adf31a58fa",
      "license": "MIT",
      "urls": [
        "bzz-raw://312e850e36efbf0f2450896c213b23dc0a28150e051bcbf933a8b9211627c44b",
        "dweb:/ipfs/QmWsyisPjDwTJrTMhsGZa4JHiCS63mWfsyVQKbaijWGdmK"
      ]
    },
    "erc20/airdrop.sol": {
      "keccak256": "0xea27a3e2c4179a064caf9fe9a198addd526fd1d1ea467ea474a0c069e6eac957",
      "urls": [
        "bzz-raw://6a86bc69b99876768bdbddba504410cf60b33681e1203a36d98840bf2ab8a42b",
        "dweb:/ipfs/QmRZSqNfAPduoPoUJ6BM4NpBTbTKBqg5Mz5YBNpaUz4TfQ"
      ]
    }
  },
}
```

These files will be like below ([see in repo](https://repo.sourcify.dev/contracts/full_match/1/0x801f3983c7baBF5E6ae192c84E1257844aDb4b4D/)):
```
contracts/full_match/1/0x801f3983c7baBF5E6ae192c84E1257844aDb4b4D/
├── metadata.json
└── sources/
    └── erc20/
        ├── IERC20.sol
        └── airdrop.sol
```
The problem with this is the part `"erc20/airdrop.sol"` is not necessarily a valid file path but a ["source unit name"](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.27/path-resolution.html#virtual-filesystem:~:text=assigned%20a%20unique-,source%20unit%20name,-which%20is%20an) in Solidity, i.e. arbitrary strings. This may cause issues on file systems as well as when pinning to IPFS.

### RepositoryV2

RepositoryV2 is the format where we normalize the file names with their keccak256 hashes (source files must have a `keccak256` field in the metadata). So the example above would look like this:

```
contracts/full_match/1/0x801f3983c7baBF5E6ae192c84E1257844aDb4b4D/
├── metadata.json
└── sources/
    └── 0xa38ec4e151e4d397d05bdfb94e6e4eb91e57a9fca3bc1c655289a4adf31a58fa
    └── 0xea27a3e2c4179a064caf9fe9a198addd526fd1d1ea467ea474a0c069e6eac957
```

The files are exactly the same so their IPFS hashes will not change, and you can look up the metadata file to find the original path-alike source unit names.

## IPFS

The sources of all verified contracts are pinned on IPFS. The logical structure of RepositoryV2 serves as the basis for uploading to IPFS. Files can be accessed via their individual CIDs (e.g. [`QmVij3h9z536ZG5cRpUmTfdoN9KR1Xp4ix2P7to9dPHgE5`](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVij3h9z536ZG5cRpUmTfdoN9KR1Xp4ix2P7to9dPHgE5)).

Unfortunately, publishing under IPNS is temporarily disabled. This is because of the difficulty of managing the whole filesystem over IPFS (with MFS etc.) and updating the IPNS regularly. 


## Download

:::danger No New Exports
Following deprecating the filesystem based repositories, **we no longer publish new exports**. We recommend resorting to the [Parquet exports](/docs/repository/sourcify-database/#download) instead. 

You can still download the existing export for a while. Double check the date of the export in the manifest file. If you need these exports please reach out to us.
:::

We compress the **RepositoryV2** weekly and publish on Cloudflare R2 under https://repo-backup.sourcify.dev ( `.dev` redirects to `.app` domain, which also belongs to Sourcify). 

<TotalRepoSize/>

[repo-backup.sourcify.dev](https://repo-backup.sourcify.dev) will redirect to a `manifest.json` file:

<details>
<summary>manifest.json</summary>

```json
{
  "description": "Manifest file for when the Sourcify file repository was uploaded",
  "timestamp": 1726030203254,
  "dateStr": "2024-09-11T04:50:03.254904Z",
  "files": [
    {
      "path": "/sourcify-repository-2025-01-06T03-00-24/full_match.1.00.tar.gz"
      "sizeInBytes": 2097152000
    },
    {
      "path": "/sourcify-repository-2025-01-06T03-00-24/full_match.1.01.tar.gz"
      "sizeInBytes": 800472503
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```
</details>

The files are split by match type, chain and the first byte of the contract address. 
E.g. `/full_match.1.2F.tar.gz` will contain all the full_match contracts for chain 1 starting with `0x2F`.

You can download all files in the `files` array and unzip them:

1. Download the manifest file (`-L` to follow redirects):
   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://repo-backup.sourcify.dev/manifest.json
   ```

2. Extract file paths and download each file:
   ```bash
   jq -r '.files[].path' manifest.json | xargs -I {} curl -L -O https://repo-backup.sourcify.dev/{}
   ```

3. Concatenate the downloaded parts:
   ```bash
   cat sourcify-repository-*.part.gz.* > sourcify-repository.gz
   ```

4. Unzip the concatenated file:
   ```bash
   tar -xvzf sourcify-repository.gz
   ```
