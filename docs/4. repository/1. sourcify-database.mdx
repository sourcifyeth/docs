# Sourcify Database

Sourcify Database is the main storage backend for Sourcify. It is a PostgreSQL database that follows the [Verified Alliance Schema](https://github.com/verifier-alliance/database-specs) as its base with few modifications.

On a high level, these modifications are: 
- Sourcify DB does accept contracts without the deployment details such as `block_number`, `transaction_hash` as well as without an onchain creation bytecode (`contracts.creation_code_hash`). 
- Stores the [Solidity metadata](/docs/metadata) separately in the `sourcify_matches` table.
- Introduces tables for other purposes.

You can follow the [`services/database/migrations`](https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/tree/staging/services/database/migrations) folder for the initial schema and the changes made to it. These are not necessarily the differences between Sourcify DB and the Verified Alliance Schema, but any changes made to the schema over time.

## Schema

You can access the live schema of the database [here](https://dbdiagram.io/d/Sourcify-DB-67fcf5ee9cea640381a217d2) or in the embedded frame below.

In short:
- Every verified contract is a coupling between a deployed contract (`contract_deployments`) and a compilation (`compiled_contracts`)
- ["Transformations"](https://verifieralliance.org/docs/transformations) are applied to reach the final matching onchain bytecode from a bytecode from a compilation. 
- Bytecodes and sources are dedeplicated. The bytecode and the sources of a popular contract like `ERC20.sol` will only be stored once in `sources` and `code` respectively.

:::warning
If the contract has ["unlinked libraries"](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.30/using-the-compiler.html#library-linking), the placeholder strings like `__$53ae...a537$__` in bytecodes will be normalized to `0000...0000`s. This is required since the `code` column is a `bytea` type in the DB. 

Therefore, the bytecode string from the DB **will not be identical** to the output of the compilation. You can "de-normalize" these fields by looking at the library transformations and filling the placeholders with the library identifier.

For more information about the schemas of the json fields below check the [Verifier Alliance repo](https://github.com/verifier-alliance/database-specs/tree/master/json-schemas).

JSON fields of `verified_contracts` table:
- `creation_values`
- `creation_transformations`
- `runtime_values`
- `runtime_transformations`

The [transformations](https://verifieralliance.org/docs/transformations) and values are the operations done on a bytecode from a compilation to reach the final matching onchain bytecode.

JSON fields of `compiled_contracts` table:
- `sources`: Source code files of a contract
- `compiler_settings`
- `compilation_artifacts`: Fields from the compilation output JSON. Fields: `abi`, `userdoc`, `devdoc`, `sources` (AST identifiers), `storageLayout`
- `creation_code_artifacts`: Fields under `evm.bytecode` field. Fields: `sourceMap`, `linkReferences`, `cborAuxdata`
- `runtime_code_artifacts`: Fields under `evm.deployedBytecode` field. Fields: `sourceMap`, `linkReferences`, `cborAuxdata`, `immutableReferences`

### Notes on the data

For the issues on the data we are aware of and plan to fix, see this issue: https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/issues/2276 

Other known inconsistencies in the data below (not planned to fix) are documented below:

- **Compiler versions**: Keep in mind the vyper version build strings are not consistent (details [here](hhttps://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/issues/2247#issuecomment-3155878775)):
  - version =< 0.3.0: The commit hash has 7 characters `0.3.0+commit.8a23feb`
  - version 0.3.1: No commit hash: `0.3.1`
  - version >= 0.3.2: The commit hash has 8 characters `0.3.2+commit.3b6a4117`

## Download

We dump the whole database daily in [Parquet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Parquet) format and upload it to a Cloudflare R2 storage. You can access the manifest file at https://export.sourcify.dev ( `.dev` redirects to `.app` domain, which also belongs to Sourcify). The script that does the dump is at [sourcifyeth/parquet-export](https://github.com/sourcifyeth/parquet-export).


[export.sourcify.dev](https://export.sourcify.dev) will redirect to a `manifest.json` file:

You can download all the files and use a parquet client to query, inspect, or process the data.

1. Download the manifest file (`-L` to follow redirects):
   ```bash
   curl -L -O https://export.sourcify.dev/manifest.json
   ```

2. Download all the tables listed in the manifest:
   ```bash
   jq -r '.files | keys[] as $k | .[$k][]' manifest.json | xargs -I {} curl -L -O https://export.sourcify.dev/{}
   ```

For example you can install the [`parquet-cli`](https://github.com/apache/parquet-java/blob/master/parquet-cli/README.md) to do basic inspection:

```bash
brew install parquet-cli

parquet meta compiled_contracts_0_5000.parquet
```

alternatively use your favorite data processing tool or import this data into a database.
