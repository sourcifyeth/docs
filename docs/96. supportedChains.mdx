# Supported Chains

You can find the Sourcify chains, i.e. EVM chains that are supported by Sourcify, and the level of support below.

:::info Adding a new chain
If you want to add a new chain support to Sourcify check out [Requesting Chain Support](/docs/chain-support) page
:::

_If the tests for a chain will fail two weeks in a row, we will assume the chain is not being maintained and remove it from the supported chains list. The tests can be seen [in CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/ethereum/sourcify?branch=master) under "test-chains-regularly" workflow_
