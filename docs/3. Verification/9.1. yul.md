# Yul verification

Sourcify supports Yul verification via the `/v2/verify` API endpoint, you can find more information in the [APIs documentation](/docs/api/).

## Yul Feature Support

- 🟢 **Match**: Sourcify uses the metadata hash as a compilation fingerprint (you can read more about it [here](/docs/exact-match-vs-match)), since Yul doesn't support metadata, every Yul match will result in a simple Match (no Exact Match).
- 🟢 **Generated metadata**: Sourcify generates a metadata file for Yul contracts, but it was used only for compatibility with the legacy API, since everything was based on the Solidity metadata.json.
- 🔴 **ABI**: Yul compilation doesn't generate ABI.
- 🔴 **Exact Match**: Not possible due to lack of metadata support.
