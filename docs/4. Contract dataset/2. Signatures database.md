title: Signatures database
---

We also build an Ethereum signature database from our verified contracts. When you verify a contract, the function, event, and error signatures are extracted from its ABI and stored in the database.

The data is stored in the same database as the verified contracts. The `signatures` table holds the signature in text and their keccak256 hashes. The `compiled_contracts_signatures` holds the mappings of signatures to compilations in a many-to-many relationship.

- **Schema**: Check [docs/repository/sourcify-database/#schema](/docs/repository/sourcify-database/#schema) for the schema.
- **API**: Check [docs/api/](/docs/api/) for the API.
- **Download**: You can download the related tables in Parquet format from [export.sourcify.dev](https://export.sourcify.dev). See [Download the Dataset](/docs/repository/download-dataset/) for more details.
- **Playground**: Visit [4byte.sourcify.dev](https://4byte.sourcify.dev) to search for signatures.
