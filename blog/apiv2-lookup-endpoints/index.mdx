We have been working on the new APIv2 for Sourcify and just shipped the first set of endpoints to lookup verified contracts and GET various types of information about the verified contract. The new information-rich endpoints allows selectively fetching the specific fields needed about the verified contract and provides a wide selection of fields. 

In this post we will walkthrough the new functionality brought by these endpoints and see how to use them.

(Edit: In addition to lookup endpoints, the verification endpoints are also live! The full API spec is [in our docs](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/api/))


## Background 

APIv2 has been the biggest priority of our project since Q4 2024 and we aim to ship it fully by Q1 2025. We've been discussing and having fruitful conversations around how to design the new API as can be seen in the [design issue](https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/issues/1545). Thanks everyone who contributed to the conversation!

The main problems we wanted to solve with and the main features we wanted from the APIv2 were the following:
- With the legacy API users had to wait for the response ie. wait for the compilation and the verification to finish. This can easily take couple minutes and the requests are left hanging. The new design should have ticketing/job-ids and users should poll with this id.
- The  "perfect" vs "partial" naming is confusing.
- The legacy API is fully based on the metadata.json. While we want to keep full support for metadata.json verification and "perfect" matching, we wanted to have standard JSON input as our main endpoint's base.
- We were able to share a lot more data around the verification after moving from a filesystem based storage to [the database](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/repository/sourcify-database/) and legacy API didn't have this information.

You can read more in [this issue](https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/issues/1470).

(Edit: The design is live [in our docs](https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/api/))

The design specifies endpoints to "Verify Contracts", check for "Verification Jobs", and to do "Contract Lookup". Here we'll talk about the "Contract Lookup" that we shipped. The others are still being developed.

## New endpoints

With [this release](https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/releases/tag/sourcify-server%402.6.0) we have 2 new endpoints:

- GET `/v2/contracts/{chainId}`: retrieve the latest verified contracts for a chain
- GET `/v2/contract/{chainId}/{address}`: retrieve a specific contract and related information

### GET `/v2/contracts/{chainId}`

This enpoint is fairly straightforward and returns an array of verified contracts. Users can provide the following parameters:

- `limit`: number of contracts to return (max. 200)
- `sort`: by most recent first (`desc`, default), or by oldest first (`asc`)
- `afterMatchId`: The last `matchId` (an incremental contract ID) returned to get contracts older or newer than it (depending on sort)

<details>
<summary> Response </summary>

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "match": "exact_match",
      "creationMatch": "exact_match",
      "runtimeMatch": "exact_match",
      "chainId": "11155111",
      "address": "0x7Bec3080cdf73a9a39997C860c19377Ac1E6E6BE",
      "verifiedAt": "2025-02-11T11:49:45Z",
      "matchId": "855557"
    },
	...
	]
}
```
</details>

Check this example:

https://sourcify.dev/server/v2/contracts/1?limit=10&sort=asc 

### GET `/v2/contract/{chainId}/{address}`

This endpoint is the more interesting one, in that, it allows us to get all details beyond just if a contract is verified.

By default this endpoint returns the minimal verification information:

https://sourcify.dev/server/v2/contract/1/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa

```json
{
  "matchId": "2115",
  "creationMatch": "exact_match",
  "runtimeMatch": "exact_match",
  "verifiedAt": "2024-08-08T10:05:44Z",
  "match": "exact_match",
  "chainId": "1",
  "address": "0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa"
}
```

As you can see we no longer use **perfect** and **partial** to refer to matches. Instead we use **exact_match** and **match** respectively. This is because the wording "partial" was causing confusion leading users to think their contract is not verified. This way we both convey that the contract is indeed verified but also by "exact_match" we express this is a superior match than just a "match". 

Above is the minimal contract information. Besides, users can choose additional fields by passing the `fields` query parameter or omit fields with `omit`.

For example, if you just need the ABI: https://sourcify.dev/server/v2/contract/1/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa?fields=abi

```json
{
  "abi": [
    { "type": "constructor", "inputs": [], "stateMutability": "nonpayable" },
		...
    {
      "name": "supportsInterface",
      "type": "function",
      "inputs": [{ "name": "interfaceId", "type": "bytes4", "internalType": "bytes4" }],
      "outputs": [{ "name": "", "type": "bool", "internalType": "bool" }],
      "stateMutability": "pure"
    }
  ],
  "matchId": "2115",
  "creationMatch": "exact_match",
  "runtimeMatch": "exact_match",
  "verifiedAt": "2024-08-08T10:05:44Z",
  "match": "exact_match",
  "chainId": "1",
  "address": "0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa"
}
```

Or you can ask for every single field by passing `all`: [https://sourcify.dev/server/v2/contract/1/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa?fields=all](https://sourcify.dev/server/v2/contract/1/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa?fields=all)

Let's have a look at each field:

You can be really specific about the fields you need:

https://sourcify.dev/server/v2/contract/1/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa?fields=runtimeBytecode.onchainBytecode,compilation.language,deployment.transactionHash

or just omit the fields you don't need

https://sourcify.dev/server/v2/contract/1/0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa?omit=compilation,runtimeBytecode,creationBytecode

### Proxy Resolution

The API uses the [WhatsABI](https://github.com/shazow/whatsabi) library to resolve proxies from the runtime bytecode of a contract. 

These are the supported proxy types as of now:

```ts
export type ProxyType =
  | "EIP1167Proxy"
  | "FixedProxy"
  | "EIP1967Proxy"
  | "GnosisSafeProxy"
  | "DiamondProxy"
  | "PROXIABLEProxy"
  | "ZeppelinOSProxy"
  | "SequenceWalletProxy";
```

See [proxy-utils.ts](https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/blob/staging/services/server/src/server/services/utils/proxy-contract-util.ts) to see how resolution is done.

## Next Steps

As said, this is just the lookup endpoints of the APIv2. In the upcoming weeks we will be developing the verificaiton and verificationJob endpoints that will support ticketing and polling, instead of hanging requests.

Once again, you can see the full up-to-date API spec at https://docs.sourcify.dev/docs/api/

You can follow along the development in our tracker issue: https://github.com/argotorg/sourcify/issues/1367

Beyond that, you can see our roadmap in our [Milestones View](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum/projects/46/views/3) for the next quarters and what we are currently working in our [Sprint Board](https://github.com/orgs/ethereum/projects/46/views/2). We welcome feedback and discussions!
